*Alot better to buy in when the board is red, think of it as a discount*

This is a summary of my project for the Pofessional Software Bootcamp through Open Avenues.  The project is still a work in progress - I'll be updating it more next month.

## Motivation

I have always been intrigued by investing and the power of compound interest. I wanted to create this application to track the status of the S&P 500 index to get updates on its price.


## Summary of approach

### When is a good time to buy-in?

For this project I wanted to have updates for when it is a good time to buy index funds. I decided to have a search feature for different stocks while also a visual for current S&P 500 price status.
