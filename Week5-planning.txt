What is the goal?
My project will be a job parser which will web scrape different websties
for new job postings. I will have to fetch the HTML content using python libraries
such as BeautifulSoup4, Requests, and Scrapy. I will need to extract job listing data
and then store in in the sqlite3 database.

Each website has their own structure and terms of service so I will need to be careful with that
Having a frontend to input the filtering options would be helpful and can be done
using the flask framework.



Data Source - Indeed, Glassdoor, LinkedIn, ZipRecuruiter
Data Storage - sqlite3 database
Data Utilization - Once the code runs and find job postings matching the users
parameters they will be added to the database in order of newest
opening to oldest. And once the code runs and finds a posting I would
like to setup email updates.
